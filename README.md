# Guideo
+
+Guideo is the ultimate tool for navigating inside buildings, such as shopping malls, corporate offices, universities, museums, etc. It uses Sphero (a robot ball) as a pilot to steer users to their destinations. Integrating the technology with Sphero, along with speech feedback from Nuance and specific Sphero accessories, makes Guideo powerful enough to guide visually impaired people from one place to another in an enclosed space. Guideo can easily detect any obstacles in its path, which allows people to navigate even in the dark!
